# Every. Wordle answer. EVER.
Seriously. It's every answer from June 19th, 2021 through October 14th, 2027.

## What is Wordle?
It's this game run by The New York Times that everyone loves for some reason. You should [check it out](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) sometime.

## Why?
Why not? Now you can show your friends your pretend psychic abilities and predict every word. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

## How?
When you load the Wordle site, every answer is downloaded at once. This data can be extracted and neatly sorted out, as seen here. Occasionally the NYT may remove or add a few words; I'll try to keep this updated when that happens.

## Nice, but where are all the answers?
The answers are sorted by year, month, then day. For example, the answer from June 27th, 2022 can be found in the 2022 folder, followed by the 06 folder, followed by the file 27.
